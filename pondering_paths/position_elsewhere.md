# Challenge Name
position elsewhere

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0AXGO_PYO2-6O0gmmZCBVYysQXx.QX3QTN0wCM2gjNzEzW}`

I was wondering why the instructions were the same as the last one. I thought when I actually did it it would be different, but it was almost the same. Why??!
```bash
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/include directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ cd /usr/include
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/usr/include$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0AXGO_PYO2-6O0gmmZCBVYysQXx.QX3QTN0wCM2gjNzEzW}
```
