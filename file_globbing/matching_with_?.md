# Challenge Name
Matching with ?

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gkQj2aOUckBk4-8jdgMtgkU5WiZ.QXyIDO0wCM2gjNzEzW}`

I was just thinking how `*` and `?` here are implementing the same concept as `%` and `_`do in MySQL
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ./run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gkQj2aOUckBk4-8jdgMtgkU5WiZ.QXyIDO0wCM2gjNzEzW}
```
